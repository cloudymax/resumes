#  Hi, I'm Max 

I'm a Full-Stack Developer, DevOps Engineer, and Architect with 11+ years experience across multiple segments of the tech industry specializing in Automation, Architecture, Developer Experience, and Games. I'm passionate about developing Interactive Experiences and Ephemeral Infrastructure with a focus on Sustainability, Decentralization and Performance. I'm excited to use Computer-Vision, Machine Learning, Digital-Twins, and Renewable Energy to redefine how we work, play, and collaborate with each other in digital spaces.

Outside of work, I enjoy cooking, reading, contributing to open-source projects, and learning about Amsterdam's hidden playgrounds as an examination of discoverability, logistics, and agency in systems design.
